    bitmap that defines what output formats a command supports, e.g.
    OVS_OUTPUT_FMT_TEXT | OVS_OUTPUT_FMT_JSON.

    'callback' is called when the command is received.  It is passed a
    UnixctlConnection object, the list of arguments as unicode strings, and
    'aux'.  Normally 'callback' should reply by calling
    UnixctlConnection.reply() or UnixctlConnection.reply_error() before it
    returns, but if the command cannot be handled immediately, then it can
    defer the reply until later.  A given connection can only process a single
    request at a time, so a reply must be made eventually to avoid blocking
    that connection."""
