      Convention for heading levels in Open vSwitch documentation:

      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2
      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.

==================
Inclusive Language
==================

In order to help facilitate an inclusive environment in the Open vSwitch
community we recognise the role of language in framing our
communication with each other. It is important that terms that
may exclude people through racial, cultural or other bias, are avoided
as they may make people feel excluded.

We recognise that this is subjective, and to some extent is a journey.
But we also recognise that we cannot begin that journey without taking
positive action. To this end Open vSwitch is adopting the practice
of an inclusive word list, which helps to guide the use of language within
the project.

.. _word list:

Word List
---------

The intent of this document is to formally document the acceptance of a
inclusive word list by Open vSwitch.  Accordingly, this document specifies
use of the use the `Inclusive Naming Word List
<https://inclusivenaming.org/word-lists/>`__ v1.0 (the word list) for Open
vSwitch.

The adoption of the word list intended that this act as a guide for
developers creating patches to the Open vSwitch repository, including both
source code and documentation. And to aid maintainers in their role of
shepherding changes into the repository.

Further steps to align usage of language in Open vSwitch, including
clarification of application of the word list, to new and existing work,
may follow.
