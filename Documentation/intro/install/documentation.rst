      Convention for heading levels in Open vSwitch documentation:

      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2
      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.

Open vSwitch Documentation
==========================

This document describes how to build the OVS documentation for use offline. A
continuously updated, online version can be found at `docs.openvswitch.org
<http://docs.openvswitch.org>`__.

.. note::
  These instructions provide information on building the documentation locally.
  For information on writing documentation, refer to
  :doc:`/internals/contributing/documentation-style`

Build Requirements
------------------

As described in the :doc:`/internals/contributing/documentation-style`, the
Open vSwitch documentation is written in reStructuredText and built with
Sphinx. A detailed guide on installing Sphinx in many environments is available
on the `Sphinx website`__ but, for most Linux distributions, you can install
with your package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu run::

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-sphinx

Similarly, on RHEL/Fedora run::

    $ sudo dnf install python3-sphinx

A ``requirements.txt`` is also provided in the ``/Documentation``, should you
wish to install using ``pip``::

    $ virtualenv .venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r Documentation/requirements.txt

__ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html

Configuring
-----------

It's unlikely that you'll need to customize any aspect of the configuration.
However, the ``Documentation/conf.py`` is the go-to place for all
configuration. This file is well documented and further information is
available on the `Sphinx website`__.

Building
--------

Once Sphinx is installed, the documentation can be built using the provided
Makefile targets::

    $ make docs-check

.. important::

   The ``docs-check`` target will fail if there are any syntax errors.
   However, it won't catch more succinct issues such as style or grammar
   issues.  As a result, you should always inspect changes visually to ensure
   the result is as intended.

Once built, documentation is available in the ``/Documentation/_build`` folder.
Open the root ``index.html`` to browse the documentation.
