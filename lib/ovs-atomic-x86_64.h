/*
 * x86_64 Memory model (http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3a-part-1-manual.html):
 *
 * - 1, 2, 4, and 8 byte loads and stores are atomic on aligned memory.
 * - Loads are not reordered with other loads.
 * - Stores are not reordered with OLDER loads.
 *   - Loads may be reordered with OLDER stores to a different memory location,
 *     but not with OLDER stores to the same memory location.
 * - Stores are not reordered with other stores, except for special
 *   instructions (CLFLUSH, streaming stores, fast string operations).
 *   Most of these are not emitted by compilers, and as long as the
 *   atomic stores are not combined with any other stores, even the allowed
 *   reordering of the stores by a single fast string operation (e.g., "stos")
 *   is not a problem.
 * - Neither loads nor stores are reordered with locked instructions.
 * - Loads cannot pass earlier LFENCE or MFENCE instructions.
 * - Stores cannot pass earlier LFENCE, SFENCE, or MFENCE instructions.
 * - LFENCE instruction cannot pass earlier loads.
 * - SFENCE instruction cannot pass earlier stores.
 * - MFENCE instruction cannot pass earlier loads or stores.
 * - Stores by a single processor are observed in the same order by all
 *   processors.
 * - (Unlocked) Stores from different processors are NOT ordered.
 * - Memory ordering obeys causality (memory ordering respects transitive
 *   visibility).
 * - Any two stores are seen in a consistent order by processors other than
 *   the those performing the stores.
 * - Locked instructions have total order.
 *
 * These rules imply that:
 *
 * - Locked instructions are not needed for aligned loads or stores to make
 *   them atomic.
 * - All stores have release semantics; none of the preceding stores or loads
 *   can be reordered with following stores.  Following loads could still be
 *   reordered to happen before the store, but that is not a violation of the
 *   release semantics.
 * - All loads from a given memory location have acquire semantics with
 *   respect to the stores on the same memory location; none of the following
 *   loads or stores can be reordered with the load.  Preceding stores to a
 *   different memory location MAY be reordered with the load, but that is not
 *   a violation of the acquire semantics (i.e., the loads and stores of two
 *   critical sections guarded by a different memory location can overlap).
 * - Locked instructions serve as CPU memory barriers by themselves.
 * - Locked stores implement the sequential consistency memory order.  Using
 *   locked instructions when seq_cst memory order is requested allows normal
 *   loads to observe the stores in the same (total) order without using CPU
 *   memory barrier after the loads.
 *
 * NOTE: Some older AMD Opteron processors have a bug that violates the
 * acquire semantics described above.  The bug manifests as an unlocked
 * read-modify-write operation following a "semaphore operation" operating
 * on data that existed before entering the critical section; i.e., the
 * preceding "semaphore operation" fails to function as an acquire barrier.
 * The affected CPUs are AMD family 15, models 32 to 63.

 * full optimization of all surrounding non-atomic variables.

 * The memory_model_relaxed does not need a compiler barrier, if the

 * respect to other atomic operations on the same memory location.  Using
 * the 'volatile' keyword in the definition of the atomic types
 * accomplishes this, as memory accesses to volatile data may not be
 * optimized away, or be reordered with other volatile accesses.
 *
 * On x86 also memory_order_consume is automatic, and data dependency on a
 * volatile atomic variable means that the compiler optimizations should not
 * cause problems.  That is, the compiler should not speculate the value of
 * the atomic_read, as it is going to read it from the memory anyway.
 * This allows omiting the compiler memory barrier on atomic_reads with
 * memory_order_consume.  This matches the definition of
 * smp_read_barrier_depends() in Linux kernel as a nop for x86, and its usage
 * in rcu_dereference().
 *
 * We use this same logic below to choose inline assembly statements with or
 * without a compiler memory barrier.
