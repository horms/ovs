/* Read-Copy-Update (RCU)
 * ======================
 *
 * Introduction
 * ------------
 *
 * Atomic pointer access makes it pretty easy to implement lock-free
 * algorithms.  There is one big problem, though: when a writer updates a
 * pointer to point to a new data structure, some thread might be reading the
 * old version, and there's no convenient way to free the old version when all
 * threads are done with the old version.
 *
 * The function ovsrcu_postpone() solves that problem.  The function pointer
 * passed in as its argument is called only after all threads are done with old
 * versions of data structures.  The function callback frees an old version of
 * data no longer in use.  This technique is called "read-copy-update", or RCU
 * for short.
 *
 *
 * Details
 * -------
 *
 * A "quiescent state" is a time at which a thread holds no pointers to memory
 * that is managed by RCU; that is, when the thread is known not to reference
 * memory that might be an old version of some object freed via RCU.  For
 * example, poll_block() includes a quiescent state.
 *
 * The following functions manage the recognition of quiescent states:
 *
 *     void ovsrcu_quiesce(void)
 *
 *         Recognizes a momentary quiescent state in the current thread.
 *
 *     void ovsrcu_quiesce_start(void)
 *     void ovsrcu_quiesce_end(void)
 *
 *         Brackets a time period during which the current thread is quiescent.
 *
 * A newly created thread is initially active, not quiescent. When a process
 * becomes multithreaded, the main thread becomes active, not quiescent.
 *
 * When a quiescient state has occurred in every thread, we say that a "grace
 * period" has occurred.  Following a grace period, all of the callbacks
 * postponed before the start of the grace period MAY be invoked.  OVS takes
 * care of this automatically through the RCU mechanism: while a process still
 * has only a single thread, it invokes the postponed callbacks directly from
 * ovsrcu_quiesce() and ovsrcu_quiesce_start(); after additional threads have
 * been created, it creates an extra helper thread to invoke callbacks.
 *
 * Please note that while a postponed function call is guaranteed to happen
 * after the next time all participating threads have quiesced at least once,
 * there is no quarantee that all postponed functions are called as early as
 * possible, or that the functions postponed by different threads would be
 * called in the order the registrations took place.  In particular, even if
 * two threads provably postpone a function each in a specific order, the
 * postponed functions may still be called in the opposite order, depending on
 * the timing of when the threads call ovsrcu_quiesce(), how many functions
 * they postpone, and when the ovs-rcu thread happens to grab the functions to
 * be called.
 *
 * All functions postponed by a single thread are guaranteed to execute in the
 * order they were postponed, however.
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *
 * Use OVSRCU_TYPE(TYPE) to declare a pointer to RCU-protected data, e.g. the
 * following declares an RCU-protected "struct flow *" named flowp:
 *
 *     OVSRCU_TYPE(struct flow *) flowp;
 *
 * Use ovsrcu_get(TYPE, VAR) to read an RCU-protected pointer, e.g. to read the
 * pointer variable declared above:
 *
 *     struct flow *flow = ovsrcu_get(struct flow *, &flowp);
 *
 * If the pointer variable is currently protected against change (because
 * the current thread holds a mutex that protects it), ovsrcu_get_protected()
 * may be used instead.  Only on the Alpha architecture is this likely to
 * generate different code, but it may be useful documentation.
 *
 * (With GNU C or Clang, you get a compiler error if TYPE is wrong; other
 * compilers will merrily carry along accepting the wrong type.)
 *
 * Use ovsrcu_set() to write an RCU-protected pointer and ovsrcu_postpone() to
 * free the previous data.  ovsrcu_set_hidden() can be used on RCU protected
 * data not visible to any readers yet, but will be made visible by a later
 * ovsrcu_set().   ovsrcu_init() can be used to initialize RCU pointers when
 * no readers are yet executing.  If more than one thread can write the
 * pointer, then some form of external synchronization, e.g. a mutex, is
 * needed to prevent writers from interfering with one another.  For example,
 * to write the pointer variable declared above while safely freeing the old
 * value:
 *
 *     static struct ovs_mutex mutex = OVS_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
 *
 *     OVSRCU_TYPE(struct flow *) flowp;
 *
 *     void
 *     change_flow(struct flow *new_flow)
 *     {
 *         ovs_mutex_lock(&mutex);
 *         ovsrcu_postpone(free,
 *                         ovsrcu_get_protected(struct flow *, &flowp));
 *         ovsrcu_set(&flowp, new_flow);
 *         ovs_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
 *     }
 *
 * In some rare cases an object may not be addressable with a pointer, but only
 * through an array index (e.g. because it's provided by another library).  It
 * is still possible to have RCU semantics by using the ovsrcu_index type.
 *
 *     static struct ovs_mutex mutex = OVS_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
 *
 *     ovsrcu_index port_id;
 *
 *     void tx()
 *     {
 *         int id = ovsrcu_index_get(&port_id);
 *         if (id == -1) {
 *             return;
 *         }
 *         port_tx(id);
 *     }
 *
 *     void delete()
 *     {
 *         int id;
 *
 *         ovs_mutex_lock(&mutex);
 *         id = ovsrcu_index_get_protected(&port_id);
 *         ovsrcu_index_set(&port_id, -1);
 *         ovs_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
 *
 *         ovsrcu_synchronize();
 *         port_delete(id);
 *     }
 *
 * Use ovsrcu_barrier() to wait for all the outstanding RCU callbacks to
 * finish. This is useful when you have to destroy some resources however
 * these resources are referenced in the outstanding RCU callbacks.
 *
 *     void rcu_cb(void *A) {
 *         do_something(A);
 *     }
 *
 *     void destroy_A() {
 *         ovsrcu_postpone(rcu_cb, A); // will use A later
 *         ovsrcu_barrier(); // wait for rcu_cb done
 *         do_destroy_A(); // free A
 *     }
