\fIdp\fR monitors, where \fIdp\fR is the name of an existing
datapath, and \fInetdev\fR is the name of one of the host's
network devices, e.g. \fBeth0\fR.  Once a network device has been added
to a datapath, the datapath has complete ownership of the network device's

A \fInetdev\fR may be followed by a comma-separated list of options.
The following options are currently supported:

.IP "\fBport_no=\fIport\fR"
Requests a specific port number within the datapath.  If this option is
not specified then one will be automatically assigned.

deletes the key-value named \fIkey\fR.  The type and port number of a

port is identified as port 0.)  If \fB\-s\fR or \fB\-\-statistics\fR
is specified, then packet and byte counters are also printed for each

.IP
The datapath numbers consists of flow stats and mega flow mask stats.
.IP
The "lookups" row displays three stats related to flow lookup triggered
by processing incoming packets in the datapath. "hit" displays number
of packets matches existing flows. "missed" displays the number of
packets not matching any existing flow and require user space processing.
"lost" displays number of packets destined for user space process but
subsequently dropped before reaching userspace. The sum of "hit" and "miss"
equals to the total number of packets datapath processed.
.IP
The "flows" row displays the number of flows in datapath.
.IP
The "masks" row displays the mega flow mask stats. This row is omitted
for datapath not implementing mega flow. "hit" displays the total number
of masks visited for matching incoming packets. "total" displays number of
masks in the datapath. "hit/pkt" displays the average number of masks
visited per packet; the ratio between "hit" and total number of
packets processed by the datapath.
.IP
If one or more datapaths are specified, information on only those
datapaths are displayed.  Otherwise, \fB\*(PN\fR displays information
about all configured datapaths.
.SS "DATAPATH FLOW TABLE DEBUGGING COMMANDS"
The following commands are primarily useful for debugging Open
vSwitch.  The flow table entries (both matches and actions) that they
work with are not OpenFlow flow entries.  Instead, they are different
and considerably simpler flows maintained by the Open vSwitch kernel
module.  Do not use commands to add or remove or modify datapath flows
if \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is running because it interferes with
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR's own datapath flow management.  Use
\fBovs\-ofctl\fR(8), instead, to work with OpenFlow flow entries.
.
.PP
The \fIdp\fR argument to each of these commands is optional when
exactly one datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the
default.  When multiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is
required.

Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath \fIdp\fR's flow
table.  Without \fB\-m\fR or \fB\-\-more\fR, output omits match fields
that a flow wildcards entirely; with \fB\-m\fR or \fB\-\-more\fR,
output includes all wildcarded fields.
.IP
If \fBfilter=\fIfilter\fR is specified, only displays the flows
that match the \fIfilter\fR. \fIfilter\fR is a flow in the form similar
to that accepted by \fBovs\-ofctl\fR(8)'s \fBadd\-flow\fR command. (This is
not an OpenFlow flow: besides other differences, it never contains wildcards.)
The \fIfilter\fR is also useful to match wildcarded fields in the datapath
flow. As an example, \fBfilter='tcp,tp_src=100'\fR will match the
datapath flow containing '\fBtcp(src=80/0xff00,dst=8080/0xff)\fR'.
.IP
If \fBpmd=\fIpmd\fR is specified, only displays flows of the specified pmd.
Using \fBpmd=\fI-1\fR will restrict the dump to flows from the main thread.
This option is only supported by the \fBuserspace datapath\fR.
.IP
If \fBtype=\fItype\fR is specified, only displays flows of the specified types.
This option supported only for \fBovs\-appctl dpctl/dump\-flows\fR.
\fItype\fR is a comma separated list, which can contain any of the following:
.
   \fBovs\fR - displays flows handled in the ovs dp
   \fBtc\fR - displays flows handled in the tc dp
   \fBdpdk\fR - displays flows fully offloaded by dpdk
   \fBoffloaded\fR - displays flows offloaded to the HW
   \fBnon-offloaded\fR - displays flows not offloaded to the HW
   \fBpartially-offloaded\fR - displays flows where only part of their proccessing is done in HW
   \fBall\fR - displays all the types of flows
.IP
By default all the types of flows are displayed.
\fBovs\-dpctl\fR always acts as if the \fBtype\fR was \fIovs\fR.

Adds or modifies a flow in \fIdp\fR's flow table that, when a packet
matching \fIflow\fR arrives, causes \fIactions\fR to be executed.
.IP
The \fBadd\-flow\fR command succeeds only if \fIflow\fR does not
already exist in \fIdp\fR.  Contrariwise, \fBmod\-flow\fR without
\fB\-\-may\-create\fR only modifies the actions for an existing flow.
With \fB\-\-may\-create\fR, \fBmod\-flow\fR will add a new flow or
modify an existing one.
.IP
If \fB\-s\fR or \fB\-\-statistics\fR is specified, then
\fBmod\-flow\fR prints the modified flow's statistics.  A flow's
statistics are the number of packets and bytes that have passed
through the flow, the elapsed time since the flow last processed a
packet (if ever), and (for TCP flows) the union of the TCP flags
processed through the flow.
.IP
With \fB\-\-clear\fR, \fBmod\-flow\fR zeros out the flow's
statistics.  The statistics printed if \fB\-s\fR or
\fB\-\-statistics\fR is also specified are those from just before
clearing the statistics.

\fBN.B.\fR(Linux specific): the \fIsystem\fR datapaths (i.e. the Linux

Enables or disables IP fragmentation handling for the userspace

Both IPv4 and IPv6 fragment reassembly are enabled by default.  Only
supported for the userspace datapath.

enhanced DOS security, higher minimum fragment sizes can usually be used.
The default IPv4 value is 1200 and the clamped minimum is 400.  The default
IPv6 value is 1280, with a clamped minimum of 400, for testing
flexibility.  The maximum fragment size is not clamped, however, setting
this value too high might result in valid fragments being dropped.  Only

If \fIct-[orig|reply]-tuple\fR is provided, flushes the connection entry
specified by \fIct-[orig|reply]-tuple\fR in \fIzone\fR.  The zone defaults

matching on the specified fields.  In order to specify only
\fIct-reply-tuple\fR, provide empty string as \fIct-origin-tuple\fR.
